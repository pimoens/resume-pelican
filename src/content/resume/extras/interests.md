Title: Interests

Apart from being an engineering student and full time nerd, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skiier and novice snowboarder. For the most part of my life, I have enjoyed playing soccer. Driven by both the love of competition and teamwork.

When indoors, I enjoy gaming. Pushing hardware to achieve the maximum performance for graphics and entertainment.
